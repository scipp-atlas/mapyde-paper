  abstract     = {The LHC data analysis software used in order to derive and publish experimental results is an important asset that is necessary to preserve in order to fully exploit the scientific potential of a given measurement. An important use-case is the re-usability of the analysis procedure in the context of new scientific studies such as the reinterpretation of searches for new physics in terms of signal models that not studied in the original publication (RECAST). We present the usage of the graph-based workflow description language yadage to drive the reinterpretation of preserved HEP analyses. The analysis software is preserved using Docker containers, while the workflow structure is preserved using plain JSON documents. This allows the re-execution of complex analysis workflows on modern distributed container orchestration systems and enables a systematic reinterpretation service based on such preserved analysis.},

This information includes generator-level truth acceptance maps and C++ analysis code snippets defining all of the signal regions in the analysis. Inside of ATLAS, the SimpleAnalysis generator-level analysis framework is used to calculate the truth-level acceptance maps with the uploaded C++ analysis fragments as well as for some systematic uncertainty evaluations. This framework is now publicly available and presented in this note. For validation, a search for supersymmetry (SUSY) in a final state with one lepton and two-$b$-jets is evaluated through this framework. Making this code public is part of the ATLAS Collaboration's commitment to "Open Science" and should improve communication with external collaborators by demonstrating how the code snippets on HEPData can be used.},
