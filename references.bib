  abstract     = {The LHC data analysis software used in order to derive and publish experimental results is an important asset that is necessary to preserve in order to fully exploit the scientific potential of a given measurement. An important use-case is the re-usability of the analysis procedure in the context of new scientific studies such as the reinterpretation of searches for new physics in terms of signal models that not studied in the original publication (RECAST). We present the usage of the graph-based workflow description language yadage to drive the reinterpretation of preserved HEP analyses. The analysis software is preserved using Docker containers, while the workflow structure is preserved using plain JSON documents. This allows the re-execution of complex analysis workflows on modern distributed container orchestration systems and enables a systematic reinterpretation service based on such preserved analysis.},
